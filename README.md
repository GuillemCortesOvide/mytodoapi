Hello World!

This repository it's about a CRUD API that creates, reads, updates and deletes users, lists and tasks asociated. Is a very basic project I developed in order to learn more about backend developement.
If any of you is way more advanced on backend development and have any suggestion is welcome. 

I used uvicorn to run this API on my machine, and now I can see it runs smooth like butter and so your machine.

I hope this project is helpful to anyone.
