Hello World!

Welcome to this repository dedicated to a CRUD API designed for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users, lists, and tasks. This project serves as a fundamental exploration into backend development, offering a straightforward implementation.

To run this API on your machine, I employed uvicorn, ensuring smooth functionality both on my system and, hopefully, on yours too.

If you are more advanced in backend development and have any suggestions or improvements, your input is highly valued.

I trust that this project proves helpful to anyone exploring similar domains.
